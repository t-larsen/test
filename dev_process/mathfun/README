An example of the use of doctest in a directory structure often used for
Python packages. We have the Python functionality in the directory "fun" and
in subfolders below that. We store all test files in a directory structure
below the main test directory named "test". The directory structure below this
is the same as for the Python code delivering the package functionality. As
example of this directory structure might be:

    __init__.py
    fun/mathfun.py
       /util.py
    README
    run_full_doctest.py
    run_single_doctest.py
    test/fun/mathfun/test_mathfun_func.dt
                    /test_mathfun_pep8.dt
                    /test_mathfun_raise.dt
            /util/test_util_func.dt
                 /test_util_io.dt
                 /test_util_pep8.dt
                 /test_util_raise.dt

PYTHONPATH need to be set to point to the folder where this README file is
found - this is the root directory of the installation. In a bash shell we may
include the following line in the file ~/.bashrc or in the file
~/.bash_profile:

    export PYTHONPATH=/Users/tl/Python/mypackage
